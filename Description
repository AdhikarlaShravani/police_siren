Upon hearing a siren of a nearby police vehicle, one might think about how this tone is being generated.
The brain behind these tones are not a microcontroller but a humble NE555 timer IC.

The list of components required for designing a police siren circuit is given below:

Breadboard
555-timer IC*2
Capacitors: 10uf, 0.01uf, 47uf, 100nf
Resistors: 1k, 4.7k, 10k
Potentiometer: 100k and 50k
9V battery
Breadboard jumper wires
